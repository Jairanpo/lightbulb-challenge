# Instructions:

1. Make sure you have **node18.x** installed along with **npm** package manager.
2. First, let's install the required dependencies with the following:
```
 npm install 
```
3. Inside the inputs folder, make sure to add the .csv file you want to process; there are a few requirements we need to fulfill for the app to run successfully:
- Your file must be a comma (,) separated matrix of numbers.
- Numbers can only be 1 for room and 0 for no-room.

4. Now you can execute the REPL with the following command:
```
npm run start
```
5. You are going to be prompted for a file name. Use the file name you placed inside the `/inputs` folder.  
6. Wait for the prompt to log the name of your resulting outputs file or go directly to the `/outputs` folder and search for the latest file created.
7. The resulting file is an HTML formatted file; you can open it in your favorite browser! üòÅ

### To exit, the application, just type `.exit` in the REPL.

The expected output should look like this:
